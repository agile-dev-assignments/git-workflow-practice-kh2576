## [Scrum = Communism (not)](https://medium.com/serious-scrum/scrum-is-not-communism-142fe0f6cbc5)

I found this article interesting because it relates to the system of software development framework we learned in class, and compared it to a governmental system that is often associated with negative connotations. This article debunks those arguments in favor of that, pointing to how Scrum teams are in fact not equal, and the ownership of the code still belongs to the organization and not the employees, though they are given the freedom to access and improve upon that code. In fact, the author of this article likens Scrum teams to capitalism, creating parallels between a free market system and the Product Owner who orders the backlog by business value. However, the author admits that this is still an imperfect analogy due to the ownership of means of production--the Scrum team doesn't own anything except their own skills.

This article was very interesting because the author compared and contrasted features of Scrum to  features of communism, capitalism, and democracy and finally came to the conclusion that scrum is not like any of these systems.
